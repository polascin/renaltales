The warning occurs because you're trying to modify session settings after the session has already started. Here's the corrected SessionManager.php:


## Key changes made:

1. **Moved session configuration before session start** - Session settings can only be changed before the session is started
2. **Used `session_set_cookie_params()`** - This is the proper way to set cookie parameters before session start
3. **Added proper session starting logic** - Check if session is already started before starting
4. **Removed session start from index.php** - Let SessionManager handle it
5. **Added exception handling** - If session fails to start, throw an exception
6. **Added logs directory creation** - Ensure log directory exists before writing to it
7. **Added session started flag** - Track if session was successfully started

This fixes the warning and ensures proper session initialization order.
