# Language System Redesign - Step 5 Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the redesign of the interaction between `LanguageDetector` and `LanguageModel` classes to improve separation of concerns and cooperation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New `LanguageDetector` Class (`src/Core/LanguageDetector.php`)

**Responsibilities:**
- User preference detection only
- Reading preferences from session, cookie, and browser
- Setting user language preferences
- Delegating language support validation to `LanguageModel`

**Key Features:**
- `detectLanguage()` - Detects user preferred language with priority: session > cookie > browser > default
- `setSessionLanguage()` - Sets language preference in session
- `setCookieLanguage()` - Sets language preference in cookie
- Requires `LanguageModel` dependency for support validation

### 2. Redesigned `LanguageModel` Class (`src/Models/LanguageModel.php`)

**Responsibilities:**
- Language loading and support checks
- Translation management
- Language file operations
- Language validation

**Key Changes:**
- Removed language detection logic (moved to `LanguageDetector`)
- Made `loadTranslations()` method public
- Added new methods: `languageFileExists()`, `getLanguageFilePath()`, `getLanguagePath()`
- Focused on language loading and support validation
- Removed session/cookie handling (moved to `LanguageDetector`)

### 3. Created `LanguageManager` Class (`src/Core/LanguageManager.php`)

**Responsibilities:**
- Coordinates interaction between `LanguageDetector` and `LanguageModel`
- Provides unified interface for language management
- Handles proper initialization and language switching

**Key Features:**
- Automatic initialization with detected language
- `setLanguage()` - Sets language with proper preference persistence
- `redetectLanguage()` - Re-runs detection and updates model
- Proxy methods for common operations

### 4. Updated Application Integration

**Files Modified:**
- `loader.php` - Added new classes to loading sequence
- `src/Controllers/ApplicationController.php` - Updated to use `LanguageManager`
- `public/index.php` - Updated to use new `LanguageManager`

## Architecture Benefits

### Separation of Concerns
- **LanguageDetector**: Focuses solely on user preference detection
- **LanguageModel**: Handles language loading, support checks, and translations
- **LanguageManager**: Coordinates the interaction between the two

### Improved Cooperation
- `LanguageDetector` delegates language support validation to `LanguageModel`
- `LanguageModel` focuses on its core competencies
- Clear dependency injection pattern

### Maintainability
- Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Easier to test individual components
- Clear interfaces between components

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage with LanguageManager
```php
$languageManager = new LanguageManager();
echo $languageManager->getCurrentLanguage(); // 'sk'
$languageManager->setLanguage('en');
echo $languageManager->getCurrentLanguage(); // 'en'
```

### Direct Usage of Components
```php
$languageModel = new LanguageModel();
$languageDetector = new LanguageDetector($languageModel);

$detectedLang = $languageDetector->detectLanguage();
$isSupported = $languageModel->isSupported($detectedLang);
$languageModel->setLanguage($detectedLang);
```

## Testing

The redesign was tested with `test_language_cooperation.php` which verifies:
- LanguageManager initialization
- Direct cooperation between LanguageDetector and LanguageModel
- Language switching functionality
- Proper separation of concerns
- Delegation patterns

All tests passed successfully, confirming the implementation meets the requirements.

## Backward Compatibility

The redesign maintains backward compatibility at the application level while improving the internal architecture. The public API remains consistent through the `LanguageManager` class.

## Future Enhancements

The new architecture provides a foundation for:
- Enhanced language detection algorithms
- Better caching mechanisms
- Multiple language preference sources
- Language-specific validation rules
- Improved error handling and logging
