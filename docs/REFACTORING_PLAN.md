# RenalTales Application Refactoring Plan

> **⚠️ ARCHIVED DOCUMENT**: This refactoring plan has been largely implemented. This document is kept for historical reference. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the current architecture documentation.

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive refactoring plan for the RenalTales application to modernize the codebase, improve maintainability, and enhance performance.

## Current State Analysis

### Architecture Issues Identified
1. **Monolithic Structure**: Single entry point with mixed concerns
2. **Dependency Management**: Manual dependency injection without proper IoC
3. **Configuration Management**: Scattered configuration files
4. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling without proper logging
5. **Testing**: Limited test coverage and structure
6. **Security**: Basic security measures, needs enhancement
7. **Performance**: No caching strategy, inefficient database queries
8. **Code Quality**: Mixed coding standards and documentation

### Technical Debt
- PHP 8.4 features not fully utilized
- No proper middleware pipeline
- Limited use of modern PHP patterns
- Inconsistent error handling
- No API versioning or rate limiting
- Missing comprehensive logging

## Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Modernization
1. **Update Project Structure**
   - Implement proper PSR-4 autoloading
   - Organize code into logical modules
   - Create proper configuration management

   - Logging (PSR-3)

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Custom exception hierarchy
   - Proper error logging
   - User-friendly error pages
   - Debug mode configuration

### Phase 2: Application Layer Refactoring
1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
   - Separate domain logic from infrastructure
   - Implement repositories and services
   - Create value objects and entities
   - Define bounded contexts

2. **CQRS Pattern Implementation**
   - Command Query Responsibility Segregation
   - Separate read and write operations
   - Implement command and query handlers

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Domain events
   - Event handlers
   - Asynchronous processing

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Improvements
1. **Database Layer**
   - Doctrine ORM optimization
   - Query optimization
   - Connection pooling
   - Migration strategy

2. **Caching Strategy**

   - Redis integration
   - Query result caching
   - Application-level caching

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Authentication middleware
   - Authorization system
   - CSRF protection
   - Input validation
   - Rate limiting

### Phase 4: API and Integration
1. **RESTful API Design**
   - Resource-oriented design
   - Proper HTTP status codes
   - API versioning
   - OpenAPI documentation

2. **GraphQL Implementation**
   - Schema definition
   - Resolvers
   - Query optimization
   - Subscription support

3. **Microservices Preparation**
   - Service boundaries
   - Inter-service communication
   - Service discovery
   - Load balancing

### Phase 5: Performance and Monitoring
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Query optimization
   - Caching strategies
   - Asset optimization
   - CDN integration

2. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Application metrics
   - Error tracking
   - Performance monitoring
   - Health checks

3. **Scaling Considerations**
   - Horizontal scaling
   - Database sharding
   - Message queues
   - Load balancing
