###### Prompt for Warp AI Agents:

Create from scratch in the directory 'G:\"Môj disk"\www\renaltales' the PHP web app with the name of "renaltales". Do not use any framework. Prepare optimal directory structure. The app should have comprehensive multilingual support for all known world language support with language detection and easy switch using national flags; and safe users management support. Apply the best software security standards. The app should display renal tales and stories from and for the community of people with various kidney disorders, on dialyis, and before or after kidnney transplant or those with no chance to get it. Stories should be of various categories. Some should be available without registration, some only for certain users. Useres should have the possibility to add new stories, that would be then revised by users with the right to do it. Translators should be able to translate stories into supported languages for stories: 'en', 'sk', 'cs', 'de', 'pl', 'hu', 'uk', 'ru', 'it', 'nl', 'fr', 'es', 'pt', 'ro', 'bg', 'sl', 'hr', 'sr', 'mk', 'sq', 'el', 'da', 'no', 'sv', 'fi', 'is', 'et', 'lv', 'lt', 'tr', 'eo', 'ja', 'zh', 'ko', 'ar', 'hi', 'th', 'vi', 'id', 'ms', 'tl', 'sw', 'am', 'yo', 'zu'. All other world languages are detected but not supported for the stories.

## Plan of Action on Friday, July 4th, 2025

1. **Initialize project configuration and dependencies**
Set up composer autoloading, environment variables for database and app keys, configure a PDO connection class, and create an `i18n/` directory for language files.
2. **Create database schema migrations**
Write SQL or migration scripts for `users` (id, name, email, password, locale, timestamps) and `stories` (id, user_id, title, body, created_at, updated_at) with appropriate indexes and foreign-key constraints.
3. **Develop User and Story models**
Implement PHP classes providing CRUD methods, validation rules, eager-loading relationships, and helpers such as `findByEmail` and `ownedBy($userId)`; ensure transaction-safe save/update/delete operations.
4. **Implement authentication core**
Build a lightweight Auth service for password hashing (`password_hash`), session management, login throttling, route-protection middleware, and CSRF token generation/validation.
5. **Create AuthController (register, login, logout)**
Handle GET/POST flows for registration and login, validate input, create users, start sessions, set flash messages, and implement logout that destroys the session.
6. **Develop StoryController (CRUD)**
Create StoryController (CRUD)
Provide actions index, create, store, show, edit, update, and delete with authorization checks ensuring only the story owner can modify content; add pagination support.
7. **Create UserController (profile management)**
Implement profile show/edit, update profile data, change password, and set preferred language, enforcing validation and re-authentication where needed.
8. **Build view templates for authentication and stories**
Create `layout.php` with header/footer/nav (including language selector and flash messages); build views `auth/login.php`, `auth/register.php`, `user/profile.php`, `story/index.php`, `story/create.php`, `story/edit.php`, and `story/show.php`.
9. **Add form validation, security, and user feedback**
Centralize validation logic, sanitize all output (`htmlspecialchars`), embed CSRF tokens in forms, show success/error flash messages, and implement rate limiting on login attempts.
10. **Implement multilingual support**
Create translation files (e.g., `en.php`, `es.php`), add a `__($key)` helper, wrap all static strings in controllers and views, and store user locale in session or cookie.
11. **Add error handling and logging**
Create a global ErrorHandler to render friendly 404/500 pages, log exceptions to files with timestamps, and surround risky controller operations with try/catch blocks.
12. **Write tests and documentation**
Use PHPUnit to test model methods and controller routes; update README with setup instructions, environment variables, and deployment guidelines.

I've successfully fixed the "Undefined constant 'DB_HOST'" error in your RenalTales application! Here's what I did:

✅ Issues Fixed:

1. Added missing DB_CHARSET to .env file - The environment variable was missing but required by the Database class
2. Updated the Database class (app/Core/Database.php) to use the configuration array instead of undefined constants:
•  Replaced DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_CHARSET constants
•  Now uses $config['database']['host'], $config['database']['database'], etc.
1. Fixed environment variable loading in public/index.php:
•  Added bootstrap autoloader to load environment variables from .env file
•  Fixed duplicate ROOT_PATH definition issue
•  Fixed missing config key reference
1. Fixed minor PHP warnings:
•  Made __wakeup() method public (required by PHP 8+)
•  Fixed config array key reference

✅ How it works now:

1. The .env file contains your database configuration
2. Bootstrap loads these environment variables
3. Config file (config/config.php) uses environment variables with fallbacks
4. Database class uses the config array instead of undefined constants

✅ The error is completely resolved:

The Database class now properly loads database configuration from the config array, eliminating the "Undefined constant 'DB_HOST'" error. Your application should now be able to load without this error (assuming MySQL server is running when you need to connect to the database).

---

✅ Database Issue Resolved!

I've successfully resolved the "Unknown database 'renaltales'" error. Here's what I accomplished:

What I did:

1. Created the 'renaltales' database using MySQL with the correct character set:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE renaltales CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```
2. Applied the database schema by running the migration file 20250704_initial_schema.sql which created:
•  9 core tables: users, stories, story_categories, story_contents, comments, etc.
•  Proper relationships: Foreign key constraints between related tables
•  Default data: 8 default story categories (General, Dialysis, Pre-Transplant, etc.)
3. Verified the setup by testing the database connection from your application

Database Tables Created:
